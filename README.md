# Homomorphic-Encryption-for-k-NN-on-the-cloud
Homomorphic Encryptions for k-NN on the cloud

Assignment 1 - Assignment 4 are the solutions to the weekly assignments provided by our mentors :
1. Assignment 1 : Introduced us to socket programming in python by simulating an interaction between 3 entities - client(query user), data owner and cloud server
2. Assignment 2 : Introduction to the sagemath library with some practice programs. Also reimplimented Assignment 1 in sage
3. Assignment 3 : Introduction to various modern cryptosystems and their implementation in python. Namely RSA, ElGamal and Paillier
4. Assignment 4 : Introduction to docker. Dockerization of Assignment 1.


The extra files folder contains alternate implementations of various programs not a part of our submissions which I have saved for reference

The Final Project folder contains the implementation of the paper. This part is currently in progress and I have uploaded the code for the lastest stable version of the code.
I am yet to : 
1. Send encrypted database to the cloud server
2. Perform K-NN transformation and relay the index set to the query user
3. Dockerize the whole application as per specifications
4. Add a README for the final project
